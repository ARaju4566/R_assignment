Hi,
Your markdown file works fine and looks clean.
1.I like your formatting of the plots.
2.The output files look to have been sorted correctly, but "?/?" replacement is missing.
3.Except for the second plot
Here are some suggestions I wish to propose:
1. It is preferred to add a .pdf copy of your Rmd file
2. I get this standard error in Chunk 26 of the Rmd file:
Column `Sample` is not found., it should work fine if 'Sample' is called as a string and x value is called correctly.
3. If I remember right, Proportion of Homozygous vs. Heterozygous Genotypes by sample was also asked. Would be fine to update that too.
4. I don't see missing data in the second part of visualization since it was ignored.
5. Need to add data inspection.

Regards,
Vaish.
